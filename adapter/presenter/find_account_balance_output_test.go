FUNCTION_DEF=func (a findAccountBalancePresenter) Output(balance domain.Money) usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput 
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `Output` method of the `findAccountBalancePresenter` struct:

```
Scenario 1: Positive Balance Conversion

Details:
  Description: Test that the Output method correctly converts a positive domain.Money value to a usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput struct with the correct balance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a domain.Money instance with a positive value.
  Act: Call the Output method of findAccountBalancePresenter with the created domain.Money.
  Assert: Verify that the returned usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput contains the correct balance value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the presenter correctly handles positive balances, which is a common scenario in account balance retrieval. It validates the core functionality of the Output method.

Scenario 2: Zero Balance Conversion

Details:
  Description: Verify that the Output method correctly handles a zero balance, converting it to a usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput struct.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a domain.Money instance with a zero value.
  Act: Call the Output method of findAccountBalancePresenter with the zero-value domain.Money.
  Assert: Check that the returned usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput has a balance of exactly 0.
Validation:
  Testing zero balance is important to ensure the presenter handles this edge case correctly, as accounts with no funds are a valid state in many systems.

Scenario 3: Negative Balance Conversion

Details:
  Description: Test the Output method's behavior when given a negative domain.Money value, ensuring it's correctly represented in the output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a domain.Money instance with a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the Output method of findAccountBalancePresenter with the negative domain.Money.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput contains the correct negative balance.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for systems that allow negative balances (e.g., overdraft facilities). It ensures the presenter accurately represents negative amounts.

Scenario 4: Large Balance Conversion

Details:
  Description: Verify that the Output method correctly handles and converts a very large balance without loss of precision.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a domain.Money instance with a very large value (e.g., billions).
  Act: Call the Output method of findAccountBalancePresenter with the large domain.Money value.
  Assert: Ensure the returned usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput contains the exact large balance without any rounding or precision loss.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the presenter can handle large monetary values accurately, which is critical for high-value accounts or financial systems dealing with large sums.

Scenario 5: Small Fractional Balance Conversion

Details:
  Description: Test the Output method's ability to accurately convert and represent very small fractional monetary values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a domain.Money instance with a very small fractional value (e.g., 0.000001).
  Act: Invoke the Output method of findAccountBalancePresenter with this small fractional domain.Money.
  Assert: Verify that the returned usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput maintains the precision of the small fractional balance.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the presenter can handle and accurately represent very small monetary amounts, which is important for systems dealing with micro-transactions or requiring high precision in financial calculations.

Scenario 6: Consistency Across Multiple Calls

Details:
  Description: Verify that the Output method produces consistent results when called multiple times with the same input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a domain.Money instance with any valid value.
  Act: Call the Output method of findAccountBalancePresenter multiple times with the same domain.Money instance.
  Assert: Check that all returned usecase.FindAccountBalanceOutput instances have identical Balance values.
Validation:
  This test ensures the deterministic behavior of the Output method, which is crucial for maintaining consistency in financial data presentation across multiple API calls or user interactions.
```

These scenarios cover a range of possible inputs and edge cases for the `Output` method, ensuring comprehensive testing of its functionality within the context of the account balance presentation use case.
