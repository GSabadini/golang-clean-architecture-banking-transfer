Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: go-clean-architecture/adapter/presenter/create_account_test.go
Test Cases:
    [Test_createAccountPresenter_Output]

Based on the provided function and context, here are some test scenarios for the `NewCreateAccountPresenter` function:

Scenario 1: Creating a New CreateAccountPresenter Instance

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the NewCreateAccountPresenter function returns a valid instance of usecase.CreateAccountPresenter.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as the function doesn't take any parameters.
  Act: Call NewCreateAccountPresenter() and store the result.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is not nil and implements the usecase.CreateAccountPresenter interface.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the factory function correctly creates and returns an object that adheres to the expected interface. It's crucial for maintaining the contract between different layers of the application.

Scenario 2: Verifying Type of Returned Object

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the returned object is of the correct underlying type (createAccountPresenter).

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewCreateAccountPresenter() and store the result.
  Assert: Use type assertion to verify that the returned object is of type createAccountPresenter.

Validation:
  Ensuring the correct concrete type is returned is important for maintaining the expected behavior and structure of the application. This test helps prevent accidental changes to the implementation.

Scenario 3: Testing Idempotency of NewCreateAccountPresenter

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that multiple calls to NewCreateAccountPresenter return functionally equivalent objects.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewCreateAccountPresenter() twice and store the results.
  Assert: Compare the two results to ensure they are functionally equivalent (though not necessarily the same instance).

Validation:
  This test ensures consistency in object creation, which is important for stateless presenters. It helps maintain predictable behavior across the application.

Scenario 4: Verifying Interface Compliance

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the returned object fully implements the usecase.CreateAccountPresenter interface.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a variable of type usecase.CreateAccountPresenter.
  Act: Assign the result of NewCreateAccountPresenter() to this variable.
  Assert: Verify that the assignment succeeds without any compile-time or runtime errors.

Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the presenter adheres to its contract, maintaining the integrity of the clean architecture design. It helps catch any accidental changes to the interface implementation.

Scenario 5: Testing for Nil Return

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that NewCreateAccountPresenter never returns nil.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewCreateAccountPresenter().
  Assert: Check that the returned value is not nil.

Validation:
  Ensuring that the function always returns a valid object is crucial for preventing nil pointer exceptions and maintaining robust error handling throughout the application.

These scenarios cover the basic functionality, type checking, consistency, and interface compliance of the NewCreateAccountPresenter function. They help ensure that the function behaves as expected within the clean architecture design of the application.
