Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: go-clean-architecture/adapter/presenter/find_all_account_test.go
Test Cases:
    [Test_findAllAccountPresenter_Output]

Based on the provided function and context, here are some test scenarios for the `NewFindAllAccountPresenter` function:

Scenario 1: Create a new FindAllAccountPresenter instance

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the NewFindAllAccountPresenter function returns a valid instance of usecase.FindAllAccountPresenter.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewFindAllAccountPresenter().
  Assert: Check that the returned value is not nil and implements the usecase.FindAllAccountPresenter interface.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the factory function correctly creates and returns an object that adheres to the expected interface. It's crucial for maintaining the contract between different layers of the application.

Scenario 2: Verify the type of the returned presenter

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the returned presenter is of the correct underlying type (findAllAccountPresenter).

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewFindAllAccountPresenter().
  Assert: Use type assertion to confirm that the returned value is of type findAllAccountPresenter.

Validation:
  Ensuring the correct concrete type is returned is important for maintaining the expected behavior and capabilities of the presenter in the application.

Scenario 3: Test the idempotency of NewFindAllAccountPresenter

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that multiple calls to NewFindAllAccountPresenter return functionally equivalent instances.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewFindAllAccountPresenter() twice.
  Assert: Compare the two returned instances to ensure they are functionally equivalent (though not necessarily the same instance).

Validation:
  This test ensures consistency in the creation of presenters, which is important for predictable behavior across the application, especially in scenarios where multiple presenters might be created.

Scenario 4: Verify the presenter implements the Output method

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the returned presenter correctly implements the Output method as defined in the usecase.FindAllAccountPresenter interface.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of domain.Account objects.
  Act: Call NewFindAllAccountPresenter() to get a presenter, then call its Output method with the prepared accounts.
  Assert: Verify that the Output method exists and can be called without panicking.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the presenter adheres to the interface contract, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the use case layer that depends on this presenter.

These scenarios cover the basic functionality of the NewFindAllAccountPresenter function, focusing on its ability to create a valid presenter instance that adheres to the expected interface and type. The actual behavior of the Output method is not tested here, as it's not part of the NewFindAllAccountPresenter function's responsibility.
