FUNCTION_DEF=func (a findAllTransferPresenter) Output(transfers []domain.Transfer) []usecase.FindAllTransferOutput
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `Output` method of the `findAllTransferPresenter` struct:

```
Scenario 1: Empty Slice of Transfers

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when an empty slice of transfers is provided. This checks if the function correctly handles zero transfers and returns an empty slice of FindAllTransferOutput.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty slice of domain.Transfer.
  Act: Call the Output method with the empty slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned slice is empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves correctly with no input, returning an empty slice rather than nil or panicking. It's important for robustness and avoiding null pointer exceptions in the calling code.

Scenario 2: Single Transfer in Slice

Details:
  Description: Test the conversion of a single domain.Transfer to FindAllTransferOutput.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with one domain.Transfer object, populating all fields with known values.
  Act: Call the Output method with this slice.
  Assert: Verify that a slice with one FindAllTransferOutput is returned, and all fields match the input Transfer.
Validation:
  This test checks the basic functionality of converting a Transfer to FindAllTransferOutput, ensuring all fields are correctly mapped and formatted.

Scenario 3: Multiple Transfers in Slice

Details:
  Description: Test the conversion of multiple domain.Transfer objects to FindAllTransferOutput.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with multiple domain.Transfer objects.
  Act: Call the Output method with this slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned slice has the same length as the input and that each FindAllTransferOutput correctly represents its corresponding Transfer.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle multiple transfers, maintaining order and correctly converting each one.

Scenario 4: Transfer with Zero Amount

Details:
  Description: Test the handling of a Transfer with a zero amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with one domain.Transfer object where the amount is set to zero.
  Act: Call the Output method with this slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned FindAllTransferOutput has an Amount of 0.0.
Validation:
  This test checks that zero amounts are handled correctly and not mistakenly converted or rounded.

Scenario 5: Transfer with Maximum Float64 Amount

Details:
  Description: Test the handling of a Transfer with the maximum possible float64 value as the amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with one domain.Transfer object where the amount is set to math.MaxFloat64.
  Act: Call the Output method with this slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned FindAllTransferOutput has an Amount equal to math.MaxFloat64.
Validation:
  This edge case test ensures that extremely large amounts are handled without loss of precision or overflow.

Scenario 6: Transfer with Minimum Time Value

Details:
  Description: Test the handling of a Transfer with the minimum possible time.Time value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with one domain.Transfer object where the CreatedAt is set to time.Time{} (zero value).
  Act: Call the Output method with this slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned FindAllTransferOutput has a CreatedAt string formatted correctly according to RFC3339.
Validation:
  This test checks the correct formatting of extreme time values, ensuring no panics occur and the format is consistent.

Scenario 7: Transfer with Maximum Time Value

Details:
  Description: Test the handling of a Transfer with the maximum possible time.Time value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with one domain.Transfer object where the CreatedAt is set to the maximum time.Time value.
  Act: Call the Output method with this slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned FindAllTransferOutput has a CreatedAt string formatted correctly according to RFC3339.
Validation:
  This edge case test ensures that extremely future dates are handled and formatted correctly.

Scenario 8: Transfers with Duplicate IDs

Details:
  Description: Test the behavior when multiple Transfers have the same ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with multiple domain.Transfer objects, some having identical IDs.
  Act: Call the Output method with this slice.
  Assert: Verify that all Transfers are converted, maintaining their order and individual data, despite having duplicate IDs.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function doesn't perform any deduplication or special handling for transfers with the same ID, preserving all input data.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and potential error conditions for the `Output` method. They test the function's ability to handle various input sizes, data types, and extreme values, ensuring robust and correct behavior across different scenarios.
