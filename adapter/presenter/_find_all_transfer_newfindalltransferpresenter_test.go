Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: go-clean-architecture/adapter/presenter/find_all_transfer_test.go
Test Cases:
    [Test_findAllTransferPresenter_Output]

Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `NewFindAllTransferPresenter` function:

Scenario 1: Create a new FindAllTransferPresenter instance

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the NewFindAllTransferPresenter function returns a valid instance of usecase.FindAllTransferPresenter.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewFindAllTransferPresenter().
  Assert: Check that the returned value is not nil and implements the usecase.FindAllTransferPresenter interface.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the factory function correctly creates and returns an object of the expected type. It's crucial for verifying that consumers of this function receive a usable presenter object.

Scenario 2: Verify the type of the returned presenter

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the returned presenter is specifically of type findAllTransferPresenter.

Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewFindAllTransferPresenter().
  Assert: Use type assertion to confirm that the returned value is of type findAllTransferPresenter.

Validation:
  While the interface is what's typically used, this test ensures that the concrete type being returned is as expected. This can be important for maintaining consistency in the codebase and catching any inadvertent changes to the implementation.

Scenario 3: Test the Output method of the returned presenter with empty input

Details:
  Description: Verify that the Output method of the returned presenter handles an empty slice of transfers correctly.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty slice of domain.Transfer.
  Act: Call NewFindAllTransferPresenter() to get a presenter, then call its Output method with the empty slice.
  Assert: Verify that the result is an empty slice of usecase.FindAllTransferOutput.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the presenter can handle edge cases, such as no transfers being present. It's important for robustness and preventing potential nil pointer dereferences or other issues when working with empty data sets.

Scenario 4: Test the Output method with a single transfer

Details:
  Description: Check if the Output method correctly transforms a single domain.Transfer into a usecase.FindAllTransferOutput.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with one domain.Transfer object.
  Act: Get a presenter using NewFindAllTransferPresenter() and call its Output method with the prepared transfer.
  Assert: Verify that the result is a slice with one usecase.FindAllTransferOutput object, correctly mapping all fields from the input.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic transformation logic in the Output method works correctly for a single item. It's crucial for verifying the core functionality of the presenter.

Scenario 5: Test the Output method with multiple transfers

Details:
  Description: Verify that the Output method correctly transforms multiple domain.Transfer objects into usecase.FindAllTransferOutput objects.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with multiple domain.Transfer objects.
  Act: Get a presenter using NewFindAllTransferPresenter() and call its Output method with the prepared transfers.
  Assert: Check that the result is a slice of usecase.FindAllTransferOutput objects, with the correct number of items and all fields properly mapped.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the presenter can handle multiple transfers correctly, which is crucial for its intended use in listing all transfers. It verifies both the transformation logic and the ability to handle collections of data.

These scenarios cover the creation of the presenter and its basic functionality. They test the normal operation (creating the presenter and transforming data), edge cases (empty input), and implicitly cover error handling by ensuring the presenter can handle various inputs without crashing. The actual implementation of these tests would depend on the specific details of the domain.Transfer and usecase.FindAllTransferOutput structs, which are not fully provided in the given context.
