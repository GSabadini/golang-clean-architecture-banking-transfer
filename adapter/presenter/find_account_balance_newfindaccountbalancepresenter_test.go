Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: go-clean-architecture/adapter/presenter/find_account_balance_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestNewFindAccountBalancePresenter
    Test_findAccountBalancePresenter_Output]

Based on the provided function and context, here are some test scenarios for the `NewFindAccountBalancePresenter` function:

Scenario 1: Return a valid FindAccountBalancePresenter instance

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that NewFindAccountBalancePresenter returns a valid instance of usecase.FindAccountBalancePresenter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewFindAccountBalancePresenter().
  Assert: Check that the returned value is not nil and implements the usecase.FindAccountBalancePresenter interface.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function returns a usable presenter object. It's crucial to verify that the returned object implements the correct interface, as it will be used in other parts of the application that expect a FindAccountBalancePresenter.

Scenario 2: Verify type of returned presenter

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the returned presenter is of the correct underlying type (findAccountBalancePresenter).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewFindAccountBalancePresenter().
  Assert: Use type assertion to confirm that the returned value is of type findAccountBalancePresenter.
Validation:
  While the interface is important for loose coupling, verifying the concrete type ensures that the correct implementation is being used. This helps maintain the expected behavior of the presenter throughout the application.

Scenario 3: Consistency of returned presenter instances

Details:
  Description: This test checks if multiple calls to NewFindAccountBalancePresenter return functionally equivalent instances.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed.
  Act: Call NewFindAccountBalancePresenter() twice.
  Assert: Compare the two returned instances to ensure they are functionally equivalent (have the same behavior).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function consistently returns presenters with the same behavior, which is important for maintaining predictable application behavior regardless of when or where the presenter is created.

Scenario 4: Verify presenter's Output method existence

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the returned presenter has a functional Output method as defined in the FindAccountBalancePresenter interface.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a presenter using NewFindAccountBalancePresenter().
  Act: Attempt to call the Output method with a sample domain.Money value.
  Assert: Verify that the method call compiles and executes without panicking.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the returned presenter adheres to the FindAccountBalancePresenter interface by having a functional Output method. It's crucial for maintaining the contract between the presenter and its users.

Note: The actual implementation of these tests would require writing Go test code, which was not requested. These scenarios provide a framework for creating comprehensive tests for the NewFindAccountBalancePresenter function, covering its basic functionality, type correctness, consistency, and interface compliance.
